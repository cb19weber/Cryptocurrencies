# Cryptocurrencies
DU Data Bootcamp: M18 - Unsupervised ML

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Project
<p>Should you invest in crypto? Such a simple question, but a lightning rod in the current investing landscape, with passionate support bases for any potential answer. The purpose of this inquiry is to provide some insight into the available, tradable cryptocurrency securities in an effort to aide in building a diversified portfolio and analysis of options.</p>

## Analysis and Challenges
<p>Preprocessing the dataset was pretty straight-forward. One key point of preprocessing data is to really understand the raw dataset before throwing some of the powerful data wrangling functions at the problem. Sometimes there is a simple resolution of just converting a series or column within a dataframe from string/object values that are essentially numbers just imported into the dataframe as an incorrect type. It is important to examine the values within these subsets of data to ensure that null or actual string values are converted appropriately.</p>
<p>Once the data was preprocessed and appropriately scaled for this challenge, determining the principle components was relatively straight-forward. The module indicated that a more thorough understanding of the principle component analysis was not necessary, but for a real value-add...(placeholder)</p>
<p>One of the really exciting abilities of <i>unsupervised</i> ML, explored in this challenge, is using various libraries and algorithms to gain a clearer understanding of the dataset. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/images/KMeans_elbow.png" align="right" width=60%> In this challenge we utilized the KMeans algorithm to cluster the dataset into similar groups. In the case of this cryptocurrency evaluation, this provided value by providing insight into cryptocurrencies that use similar constructs. As diversification is a key aspect of risk mitigation in investing, the ability to effectively cluster groups of similar currencies pools the data for more compartmentalized evaluation and analysis. In this dataset, we see the clear turning point in the KMeans visual at k=4. Grouping the dataset into more than four groups might expose the ML model to overfitting, while utilizing fewer than k=4 might not give all of the valuable information available to users of the model.</p>
<p>Viewing the 3D model of the KMeans groups gives a much clearer picture of how closely related some of the cryptocurrencies are. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/images/3D_scatter.png" align="left" width=85%> Class 2 and 3 are pretty clear distinctions here. It's notable that BitTorrent was not only the lone member of Class 2, but also a significant outlier among the tradable securities. Further analysis should be taken to explore the most impactful features of this cryptocurrency and how those features affect market volotility and return. Class 3 also has a very small sample of four members, which is probably small enough that we'd want to further explore the details behind such classification.</p>
<p>Utilizing hvplot to create what feels like a more traditional table is helpful for performing some of the initial exploratory analysis of the KMeans groups. The prooftype of each virtual currency seems to be at least one of the main drivers of the classification variance, and as such research into the uniqueness of the prooftypes and how they affect property valuation should be explored.</p>

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
<p>There is a tremendous amount of higher level mathematics required in some of the algorithms used at this point of ML. I love math and learning, so getting into depth on the math behind these algorithms is an exciting frontier, but certainly a challenging one. Really gaining even a baseline understanding of principle components was one such of these challenges that I will surely have to spend more significant time on.</p>
