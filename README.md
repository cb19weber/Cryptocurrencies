# Cryptocurrencies
DU Data Bootcamp: M18 - Unsupervised ML

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Project
<p>Should you invest in crypto? Such a simple question, but a lightning rod in the current investing landscape, with passionate support bases for any potential answer. The purpose of this inquiry is to provide some insight into the available, tradable cryptocurrency securities in an effort to aide in building a diversified portfolio and analysis of options.</p>

## Analysis and Challenges
<p>Preprocessing the dataset was pretty straight-forward. One key point of preprocessing data is to really understand the raw dataset before throwing some of the powerful data wrangling functions at the problem. Sometimes there is a simple resolution of just converting a series or column within a dataframe from string/object values that are essentially numbers just imported into the dataframe as an incorrect type. It is important to examine the values within these subsets of data to ensure that null or actual string values are converted appropriately.</p>
<p>Once the data was preprocessed and appropriately scaled for this challenge, determining the principle components was relatively straight-forward. The module indicated that a more thorough understanding of the principle component analysis was not necessary, but for a real value-add...(placeholder)</p>
<p>One of the really exciting abilities of <i>unsupervised</i> ML, explored in this challenge, is using various libraries and algorithms to gain a clearer understanding of the dataset. In this challenge we utilized the KMeans algorithm to cluster the dataset into similar groups. In the case of this cryptocurrency evaluation, this provided value by providing insight into cryptocurrencies that use similar constructs. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/images/KMeans_elbow.png" align="right" width=60%> As diversification is a key aspect of risk mitigation in investing, the ability to effectively cluster groups of similar currencies pools the data for more compartmentalized evaluation and analysis.</p>
